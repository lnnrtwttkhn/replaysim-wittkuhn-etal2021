## Build

### Make

You can also run the code using `make` by running the following command.

```bash
make all
```

### Docker

We've created a Docker container (see [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)) and [uploaded it](https://hub.docker.com/r/lennartwittkuhn/replaysim-wittkuhn-etal2021) to dockerhub.

#### Running the container

You can run the `make` command inside the Docker container:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/home lennartwittkuhn/replaysim-wittkuhn-etal2021 /bin/sh -c "cd /home; make all"
```

The figures created by the simulation can be retrieved as Build Artifacts.
Search the latest executed workflow and Build Artifacts [here](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/replaysim-wittkuhn-etal2021/actions/) to download the figures.

#### Building the container

The commands below were used by us to create the container.
They are listed here for documentation purposes.

```bash
docker login
```

```bash
docker build -t lennartwittkuhn/replaysim-wittkuhn-etal2021:latest .
```

```bash
docker push lennartwittkuhn/replaysim-wittkuhn-etal2021:latest
```
